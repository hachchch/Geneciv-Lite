Following the event, coal-forming tropical forests continued in large areas of the Earth, but their extent and composition were changed.",

In one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, dry spot in prebiotic conditions. He found that, as they dried, the amino acids formed long, often cross-linked, thread-like microscopic polypeptide globules, he named 'Proteinoid microspheres'.",
